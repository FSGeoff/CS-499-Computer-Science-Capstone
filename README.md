# Self Introduction/Assessment


My name is Geoff Nix, and I have been enrolled in the SNHU Computer Science program since March 2021. During my time in the Computer Science program, I have learned several essential concepts and skills. Three of the most important ones are:
+ Proficiency in programming languages, particularly Python, which I will be using to fulfill the requirements of the pseudo-code provided.	
+ Understanding of data structures and algorithms, which I will be applying to improve the efficiency and complexity of the Appointment.java file in the CS-300_Algorithms repository.
+ Software design and engineering principles, which I will be demonstrating through the development of a well-structured and robust Python program with input validation and error handling.

In addition to the programming, data structures, and software design skills, I have also gained valuable knowledge in database management through the DAD 220: Introduction to SQL course. I am capable of expanding SQL queries to perform more advanced data analysis and mining on the Orders and RMA tables. This includes implementing SQL functions, stored procedures, and views to generate insights, such as identifying top-selling products by revenue or quantity, segmenting customers based on order history and RMA data, and analyzing trends in order and RMA volumes over time. By demonstrating my proficiency in database management and data-driven decision-making, I will further strengthen my capabilities as a well-rounded software engineer.

The skills and knowledge I will demonstrate through these projects directly contribute to my targeted specialization in software engineering. By showcasing my ability to design, develop, and optimize software solutions, I am aligning myself with the core competencies required for a successful career in software engineering. The combination of programming proficiency, data structure and algorithm expertise, and software design principles will make me a well-rounded and competent software engineer, well-positioned to excel in my chosen specialization.
